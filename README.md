# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-Digitalbot
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain, Pinecone, and OpenAI to build a digitalbot capable of answering questions based on proprietary information. This approach enhances Large Language Models (LLM) by integrating real-time retrieval with text generation for more accurate responses.
